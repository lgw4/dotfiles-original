My "dotfiles." Probably of no interest to anyone other than myself.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My collection of "dotfiles." I recently switched to [dotfiles](https://github.com/jbernard/dotfiles)
for dotfile management. It's a lighter solution than [Dotify](http://mattdbridges.github.com/dotify/)
(not that I didn't *like* Dotify), and I think it fits my workflow a little better.

I'm trying to make all my managed dotfiles portable between GNU/Linux and OS X systems.
