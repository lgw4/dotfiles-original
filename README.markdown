# `${HOME}/.dotfiles`

My collection of _dotfiles_. I recently switched to [dotfiles](https://github.com/jbernard/dotfiles) for dotfile management. It's a lighter solution than [Dotify](http://mattdbridges.github.com/dotify/) (not that I didn't _like_ Dotify), and I think it fits my workflow a little better.

I intend for my managed dotfiles to be portable between GNU/Linux and macOS systems.
